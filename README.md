# Sign-Lang-detection-model
#LSTM- are long short-term memory networks that use (ANN) artificial neural networks 
in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning. In contrast to normal 
feed-forward neural networks, also known as recurrent neural networks, these networks 
feature feedback connections.

Here's a brief overview of how LSTM networks work:

#Memory Cells: LSTMs contain memory cells that can store information over time. 
These cells maintain a state vector, which can be updated or forgotten based on the input data.

#Gates: LSTMs use different types of gates to control the flow of information within the network:

#Forget Gate: Determines which information to discard from the cell state.
#Input Gate: Determines which new information to store in the cell state.
#Output Gate: Determines which information to output from the cell state.
#Cell State: The cell state serves as a conveyor belt that runs through the entire sequence, 
allowing information to flow along it while being modified by the gates.

#Hidden State: The hidden state is the output of the LSTM cell, which is based on the current input and the previous hidden state. It can be used for prediction tasks or passed to subsequent LSTM cells in a sequence.

LSTM networks are particularly effective for tasks involving sequential data, such as natural language processing (NLP), 
speech recognition, time series forecasting, and more. They have become a fundamental building block in many deep learning 
architectures, enabling models to capture complex temporal dependencies in data.
